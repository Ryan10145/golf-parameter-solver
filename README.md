# Golf Simulator

## TODO List
- Get spheres to not hit each other
- Get spheres to not have physics immediately applied to them
- Get spheres to all start in the same position
- Set initial velocity of spheres
- Adjust parameters of spheres so they seem to act like golf balls
- Scale up the size of the terrain / scale down the size of the spheres
- Fix the texturing of the spheres
- Make a lot more spheres
- Add goals
