# Golf Phase Space Simulator

A golf simulator built with reactphysics3d that generates phase space diagrams based on which angles and launch velocities successfully land balls in the hole. Uses OpenGL to render the golf course and ImGui for the user interface.

Built with Cherno's OpenGL-Core library that uses premake for generating project files.
